Text: I work as part of a multidisciplinary team  who is continually delivering projects for the Royal Navy. Last year the new careers section was launched in order to attract the 5000 new recruits needed each year. The Graduates section of the careers site won a UXUK award and was voted in the top three most engaging and impactful careers website by the Times Top 100 Graduate recruitment awards.
